# 🐄 AI-Driven Cattle Movement Prediction (v3)

## Overview

Unpredictable cattle movement in South Sudan contributes to local conflict, resource scarcity, and humanitarian risk. There is currently no reliable, real-time way to understand where cattle are located or how they are likely to move over time.

This project explores how **AI-based mapping and predictive modeling**, using **open-source satellite imagery and environmental data**, can be used to **detect, predict, and visualize cattle presence and movement**.

Version **v3** represents a major milestone. It transitions the project from rule-based inference to a **trainable neural network** with persistent learning, while maintaining a clean, interpretable visual interface.

This system **does not use GPS collars or direct tracking**. All predictions rely on **satellite imagery and environmental signals**, aligned with real-world constraints.

Satellite Data Requirements
The AI model is designed to operate on Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery.

Three spectral bands are required:

File	Band	Description	Why it matters
B03.tif	Green	Vegetation reflectance	Grass health
B04.tif	Red	Chlorophyll absorption	Grazing quality
B08.tif	Near-Infrared	Biomass density	Pasture availability
These files must be placed in:

data/sentinel/
Obtaining Sentinel-2 Data (Recommended)
Option A — Google Earth Engine (Preferred)
Apply for access: https://earthengine.google.com

Load the Sentinel-2 Level-2A collection

Filter imagery by:

Region: South Sudan

Cloud cover < 10%

Select and export the following bands:

B03

B04

B08

Export as GeoTIFF

Rename the downloaded files:

B03.tif
B04.tif
B08.tif
and place them in:

data/sentinel/
Option B — Manual Download (ESA Hub)
Use https://scihub.copernicus.eu

Download Sentinel-2 products

Extract .jp2 band files

Convert to .tif using QGIS or GDAL

Development Without Real Satellite Data
For UI testing or early development, placeholder raster files can be generated:

python tools/create_dummy_sentinel.py
This creates synthetic .tif files so the application can run without real satellite imagery.

⚠️ AI predictions will not be meaningful without real Sentinel-2 data.

AI Model & Learning Persistence
The AI component is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to predict cattle presence probability across space.

The trained model is saved to:

model/cattle_cnn.pt
This file is created automatically after training

Pressing Save AI in the application writes the model to disk

Learning persists between sessions

Deleting this file resets the AI’s knowledge

This mirrors real-world ML workflows used in research and production systems.

Environmental & Climate Metadata
The optional file:

data/climate.json
can store environmental context that influences cattle movement:

{
  "avg_temperature_c": 34,
  "rainfall_mm": 80,
  "season": "dry",
  "flood_risk": 0.6
}
This enables future multi-modal learning combining satellite imagery with climate data.

Running the Project
Requirements
Python 3.10+

PyTorch

AI Prediction Overlay
The AI produces a confidence heatmap indicating where cattle are likely to be.

Color	Interpretation
Dark Yellow	Very high confidence
Yellow	Probable
Light Yellow	Possible
Green	Unlikely
Confidence is relative within each scenario, ensuring that high-confidence regions always exist even as conditions change.

GitHub Notes
The following files should not be committed to the repository:

data/sentinel/
model/
*.pt
Recommended .gitignore entries:

data/sentinel/
model/
*.pt
This keeps the repository lightweight and reproducible.

Disclaimer
This project does not use GPS collars, tags, or direct tracking of animals.

All predictions are derived from:

Satellite imagery

Environmental signals

Learned spatial patterns

The system is intended for research, planning, and early-warning insights, not individual animal tracking.

Future Work
Temporal modeling (multi-date satellite imagery)

Movement forecasting using time-series models

Conflict-risk overlays

Integration with humanitarian dashboards

Real-time ingestion pipelines
